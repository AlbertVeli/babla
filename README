Shellscript to fetch translations from bab.la.

DESCRIPTION

The main script is svensk-engelsk.sh which translates from
Swedish to English. There are also a number of symbolic
links that calls the same script but translates from
other from-to language combinations that bab.la supports.
To add a new combination just create a new symbolic link.
Make sure that combination is supported by bab.la first.

FILES

The script calls html2text (https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text)
and perl, which must also be installed.


EXAMPLE

./svensk-engelsk.sh uppsats

This will try to get the translation of the word 'uppsats'.
If parsing is successful the output should look something like:

paper {substantiv}
essay {substantiv}
composition {substantiv}
article {substantiv}

While the command:

./engelsk-tysk.sh annotate

will translate the word 'annotate' from English to German (tyska).

Without a word

./svensk-engelsk.sh

will list all combinations.
